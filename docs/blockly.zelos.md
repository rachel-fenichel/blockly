## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [BottomRow](./blockly.zelos.bottomrow.md) | An object containing information about what elements are in the bottom row of a block as well as spacing information for the top row. Elements in a bottom row can consist of corners, spacers and next connections. |
|  [ConstantProvider](./blockly.zelos.constantprovider.md) | An object that provides constants for rendering blocks in Zelos mode. |
|  [Drawer](./blockly.zelos.drawer.md) | An object that draws a block based on the given rendering information. |
|  [PathObject](./blockly.zelos.pathobject.md) | An object that handles creating and setting each of the SVG elements used by the renderer. |
|  [Renderer](./blockly.zelos.renderer.md) | <p>The zelos renderer. This renderer emulates Scratch-style and MakeCode-style rendering.</p><p>Zelos is the ancient Greek spirit of rivalry and emulation.</p> |
|  [RenderInfo](./blockly.zelos.renderinfo.md) | <p>An object containing all sizing information needed to draw this block.</p><p>This measure pass does not propagate changes to the block (although fields may choose to rerender when getSize() is called). However, calling it repeatedly may be expensive.</p> |
|  [RightConnectionShape](./blockly.zelos.rightconnectionshape.md) | An object containing information about the space a right connection shape takes up during rendering. |
|  [StatementInput](./blockly.zelos.statementinput.md) | An object containing information about the space a statement input takes up during rendering. |
|  [TopRow](./blockly.zelos.toprow.md) | An object containing information about what elements are in the top row of a block as well as sizing information for the top row. Elements in a top row can consist of corners, hats, spacers, and previous connections. After this constructor is called, the row will contain all non-spacer elements it needs. |
