## IConnectionChecker interface

Class for connection type checking logic.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface IConnectionChecker 
```

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [canConnect(a, b, isDragging, opt\_distance)](./blockly.iconnectionchecker.canconnect.md) | Check whether the current connection can connect with the target connection. |
|  [canConnectWithReason(a, b, isDragging, opt\_distance)](./blockly.iconnectionchecker.canconnectwithreason.md) | Checks whether the current connection can connect with the target connection, and return an error code if there are problems. |
|  [doDragChecks(a, b, distance)](./blockly.iconnectionchecker.dodragchecks.md) | Check whether this connection can be made by dragging. |
|  [doSafetyChecks(a, b)](./blockly.iconnectionchecker.dosafetychecks.md) | Check that connecting the given connections is safe, meaning that it would not break any of Blockly's basic assumptions (e.g. no self connections). |
|  [doTypeChecks(a, b)](./blockly.iconnectionchecker.dotypechecks.md) | Check whether this connection is compatible with another connection with respect to the value type system. E.g. square\_root("Hello") is not compatible. |
|  [getErrorMessage(errorCode, a, b)](./blockly.iconnectionchecker.geterrormessage.md) | Helper method that translates a connection error code into a string. |
