## CodeGenerator.isInitialized property

Whether the init method has been called. Generators that set this flag to false after creation and true in init will cause blockToCode to emit a warning if the generator has not been initialized. If this flag is untouched, it will have no effect.

**Signature:**

```typescript
isInitialized: boolean | null;
```
