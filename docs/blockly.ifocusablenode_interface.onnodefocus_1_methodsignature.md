## IFocusableNode.onNodeFocus() method

Called when this node receives active focus.

Note that it's fine for implementations to change visibility modifiers, but they should avoid the following: - Creating or removing DOM elements (including via the renderer or drawer). - Affecting focus via DOM focus() calls or the FocusManager.

**Signature:**

```typescript
onNodeFocus(): void;
```
**Returns:**

void
