## Grid.setSnapToGrid() method

Sets whether blocks should snap to the grid or not.

Setting this to true does not trigger snapping. If you want to snap blocks to the grid programmatically that needs to be triggered on individual top-level blocks. The next time a block is dragged and dropped it will snap to the grid.

**Signature:**

```typescript
setSnapToGrid(snap: boolean): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  snap | boolean |  |

**Returns:**

void
