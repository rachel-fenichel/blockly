## IFocusableTree.getRootFocusableNode() method

Returns the top-level focusable node of the tree.

It's expected that the returned node will be focused in cases where FocusManager wants to focus a tree in a situation where it does not currently have a focused node.

```typescript
getRootFocusableNode(): IFocusableNode;
```
**Returns:**
