## RenderedConnection.showContextMenu() method

Handles showing the context menu when it is opened on a connection. Note that typically the context menu can't be opened with the mouse on a connection, because you can't select a connection. But keyboard users may open the context menu with a keyboard shortcut.

**Signature:**

```typescript
showContextMenu(e: Event): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  e | Event | Event that triggered the opening of the context menu. |

**Returns:**

void
