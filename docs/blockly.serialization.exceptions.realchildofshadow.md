## serialization.exceptions.RealChildOfShadow class

Represents an error where deserialization encountered a real block as it was deserializing children of a shadow. This is an error because it is an invariant of Blockly that shadow blocks do not have real children.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class RealChildOfShadow extends DeserializationError 
```
**Extends:** [DeserializationError](./blockly.serialization.exceptions.deserializationerror.md)

## Remarks

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `RealChildOfShadow` class.
