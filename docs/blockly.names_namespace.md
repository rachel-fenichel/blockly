## Enumerations

|  Enumeration | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [NameType](./blockly.names_namespace.nametype_enum.md) | Enum for the type of a name. Different name types may have different rules about collisions. When JavaScript (or most other languages) is generated, variable 'foo' and procedure 'foo' would collide. However, Blockly has no such problems since variable get 'foo' and procedure call 'foo' are unambiguous. Therefore, Blockly keeps a separate name type to disambiguate. getName('foo', 'VARIABLE') = 'foo' getName('foo', 'PROCEDURE') = 'foo2' |
