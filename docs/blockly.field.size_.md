[Home](./index.md) &gt; [blockly](./blockly.md) &gt; [Field](./blockly.field.md) &gt; [size\_](./blockly.field.size_.md)

## Field.size\_ property

Gets the size of this field. Because getSize() and updateSize() have side effects, this acts as a shim for subclasses which wish to adjust field bounds when setting/getting the size without triggering unwanted rendering or other side effects. Note that subclasses must override \*both\* get and set if either is overridden; the implementation may just call directly through to super, but it must exist per the JS spec.

**Signature:**

```typescript
protected get size_(): Size;

protected set size_(newValue: Size);
```
