## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [BadConnectionCheck](./blockly.serialization.exceptions.badconnectioncheck.md) | Represents an error where deserialization tried to connect two connections that were not compatible. |
|  [DeserializationError](./blockly.serialization.exceptions.deserializationerror.md) |  |
|  [MissingBlockType](./blockly.serialization.exceptions.missingblocktype.md) | Represents an error where the serialized state is expected to provide a block type, but it is not provided. |
|  [MissingConnection](./blockly.serialization.exceptions.missingconnection.md) | Represents an error where deserialization encountered a block that did not have a connection that was defined in the serialized state. |
|  [RealChildOfShadow](./blockly.serialization.exceptions.realchildofshadow.md) | Represents an error where deserialization encountered a real block as it was deserializing children of a shadow. This is an error because it is an invariant of Blockly that shadow blocks do not have real children. |
