## Flyout.dragAngleRange\_ property

Range of a drag angle from a flyout considered "dragging toward workspace". Drags that are within the bounds of this many degrees from the orthogonal line to the flyout edge are considered to be "drags toward the workspace".

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
protected dragAngleRange_: number;
```

## Example


```
Flyout                                                 Edge   Workspace
[block] /  <-within this angle, drags "toward workspace" |
[block] ---- orthogonal to flyout boundary ----          |
[block] \                                                |
```
The angle is given in degrees from the orthogonal.

This is used to know when to create a new block and when to scroll the flyout. Setting it to 360 means that all drags create a new block.
