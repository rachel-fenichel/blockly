## Touch.shouldHandleEvent() function

Decide whether Blockly should handle or ignore this event. Mouse and touch events require special checks because we only want to deal with one touch stream at a time. All other events should always be handled.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function shouldHandleEvent(e: Event): boolean;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  e | Event | The event to check. |

<b>Returns:</b>

boolean

True if this event should be passed through to the registered handler; false if it should be blocked.
