## LineCursor.atEndOfLine() method

Returns true iff the node to which we would navigate if in() were called is the same as the node to which we would navigate if next() were called - in effect, if the LineCursor is at the end of the 'current line' of the program.

**Signature:**

```typescript
atEndOfLine(): boolean;
```
**Returns:**

boolean
