## WorkspaceDragger class

Class for a workspace dragger. It moves the workspace around when it is being dragged by a mouse or touch. Note that the workspace itself manages whether or not it has a drag surface and how to do translations based on that. This simply passes the right commands based on events.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class WorkspaceDragger 
```
