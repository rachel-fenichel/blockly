## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [alert(message, opt\_callback)](./blockly.dialog.alert.md) | Wrapper to window.alert() that app developers may override via setAlert to provide alternatives to the modal browser window. |
|  [confirm(message, callback)](./blockly.dialog.confirm.md) | Wrapper to window.confirm() that app developers may override via setConfirm to provide alternatives to the modal browser window. |
|  [prompt(message, defaultValue, callback)](./blockly.dialog.prompt.md) | Wrapper to window.prompt() that app developers may override via setPrompt to provide alternatives to the modal browser window. Built-in browser prompts are often used for better text input experience on mobile device. We strongly recommend testing mobile when overriding this. |
|  [setAlert(alertFunction)](./blockly.dialog.setalert.md) | Sets the function to be run when Blockly.dialog.alert() is called. |
|  [setConfirm(confirmFunction)](./blockly.dialog.setconfirm.md) | Sets the function to be run when Blockly.dialog.confirm() is called. |
|  [setPrompt(promptFunction)](./blockly.dialog.setprompt.md) | <p>Sets the function to be run when Blockly.dialog.prompt() is called.</p><p>\*\*Important\*\*: When overridding this, be aware that non-native prompt experiences may require managing ephemeral focus in FocusManager. This isn't needed for the native window prompt because it prevents focus from being changed while open.</p> |
|  [setToast(toastFunction)](./blockly.dialog.settoast.md) | Sets the function to be run when Blockly.dialog.toast() is called. |
|  [toast(workspace, options)](./blockly.dialog.toast.md) | Displays a temporary notification atop the workspace. Blockly provides a default toast implementation, but developers may provide their own via setToast. For simple appearance customization, CSS should be sufficient. |
