## FocusManager.registerTree() method

Registers a new IFocusableTree for automatic focus management.

If the tree currently has an element with DOM focus, it will not affect the internal state in this manager until the focus changes to a new, now-monitored element/node.

This function throws if the provided tree is already currently registered in this manager. Use isRegistered to check in cases when it can't be certain whether the tree has been registered.

**Signature:**

```typescript
registerTree(tree: IFocusableTree): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  tree | [IFocusableTree](./blockly.ifocusabletree_interface.md) |  |

**Returns:**

void
