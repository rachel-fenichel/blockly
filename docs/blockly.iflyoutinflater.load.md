## IFlyoutInflater.load() method

Loads the object represented by the given state onto the workspace.

Note that this method's interface is identical to that in ISerializer, to allow for code reuse.

**Signature:**

```typescript
load(state: object, flyout: IFlyout): FlyoutItem;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  state | object | A JSON representation of an element to inflate on the flyout. |
|  flyout | [IFlyout](./blockly.iflyout.md) | The flyout on whose workspace the inflated element should be created. If the inflated element is an <code>IRenderedElement</code> it itself or the inflater should append it to the workspace; the flyout will not do so itself. The flyout is responsible for positioning the element, however. |

**Returns:**

[FlyoutItem](./blockly.flyoutitem.md)

The newly inflated flyout element.
