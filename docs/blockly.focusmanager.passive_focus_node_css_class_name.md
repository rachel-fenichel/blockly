## FocusManager.PASSIVE\_FOCUS\_NODE\_CSS\_CLASS\_NAME property

The CSS class assigned to IFocusableNode elements that presently have passive focus (that is, they were the most recent node in their relative tree to have active focus--see ACTIVE\_FOCUS\_NODE\_CSS\_CLASS\_NAME--and will receive active focus again if their surrounding tree is requested to become focused, i.e. using focusTree below).

See ACTIVE\_FOCUS\_NODE\_CSS\_CLASS\_NAME for caveats and limitations around using this constant directly (generally it never should need to be used).

**Signature:**

```typescript
static readonly PASSIVE_FOCUS_NODE_CSS_CLASS_NAME = "blocklyPassiveFocus";
```
