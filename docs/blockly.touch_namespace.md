## Touch namespace

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [checkTouchIdentifier(e)](./blockly.touch_namespace.checktouchidentifier_1_function.md) | Check whether the pointer identifier on the event matches the current saved identifier. If the current identifier was unset, save the identifier from the event. This starts a drag/gesture, during which pointer events with other identifiers will be silently ignored. |
|  [clearTouchIdentifier()](./blockly.touch_namespace.cleartouchidentifier_1_function.md) | Clear the touch identifier that tracks which touch stream to pay attention to. This ends the current drag/gesture and allows other pointers to be captured. |
|  [getTouchIdentifierFromEvent(e)](./blockly.touch_namespace.gettouchidentifierfromevent_1_function.md) | Get the pointer identifier from the given event. |
|  [shouldHandleEvent(e)](./blockly.touch_namespace.shouldhandleevent_1_function.md) | Decide whether Blockly should handle or ignore this event. Mouse and touch events require special checks because we only want to deal with one touch stream at a time. All other events should always be handled. |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [TOUCH\_ENABLED](./blockly.touch_namespace.touch_enabled_variable.md) | Whether touch is enabled in the browser. Copied from Closure's goog.events.BrowserFeature.TOUCH\_ENABLED |
|  [TOUCH\_MAP](./blockly.touch_namespace.touch_map_variable.md) | The TOUCH\_MAP lookup dictionary specifies additional touch events to fire, in conjunction with mouse events. |
