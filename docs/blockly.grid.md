|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [alignXY(xy)](./blockly.grid.alignxy.md) |  | Given a coordinate, return the nearest coordinate aligned to the grid. |

|  [setSnapToGrid(snap)](./blockly.grid.setsnaptogrid.md) |  | <p>Sets whether blocks should snap to the grid or not.</p><p>Setting this to true does not trigger snapping. If you want to snap blocks to the grid programmatically that needs to be triggered on individual top-level blocks. The next time a block is dragged and dropped it will snap to the grid.</p> |
|  [setSpacing(spacing)](./blockly.grid.setspacing.md) |  | <p>Sets the spacing between the centers of the grid lines.</p><p>This does not trigger snapping to the newly spaced grid. If you want to snap blocks to the grid programmatically that needs to be triggered on individual top-level blocks.
