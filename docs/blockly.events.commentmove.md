|  [newCoordinate\_?](./blockly.events.commentmove.newcoordinate_.md) |  | [Coordinate](./blockly.utils.coordinate.md) | _(Optional)_ The location of the comment after the move, in workspace coordinates. |
|  [oldCoordinate\_?](./blockly.events.commentmove.oldcoordinate_.md) |  | [Coordinate](./blockly.utils.coordinate.md) | _(Optional)_ The location of the comment before the move, in workspace coordinates. |
|  [reason?](./blockly.events.commentmove.reason.md) |  | string\[\] | _(Optional)_ An explanation of what this move is for. Known values include: 'drag' -- A drag operation completed.
