## Css.inject() function

Inject the CSS into the DOM. This is preferable over using a regular CSS file since: a) It loads synchronously and doesn't force a redraw later. b) It speeds up loading by not blocking on a separate HTTP transfer. c) The CSS content may be made dynamic depending on init options.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function inject(hasCss: boolean, pathToMedia: string): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  hasCss | boolean | If false, don't inject CSS (providing CSS becomes the document's responsibility). |
|  pathToMedia | string | Path from page to the Blockly media directory. |

**Returns:**

void
