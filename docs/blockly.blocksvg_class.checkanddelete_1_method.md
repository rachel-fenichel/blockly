## BlockSvg.checkAndDelete() method

Delete a block and hide chaff when doing so. The block will not be deleted if it's in a flyout. This is called from the context menu and keyboard shortcuts as the full delete action. If you are disposing of a block from the workspace and don't need to perform flyout checks, handle event grouping, or hide chaff, then use `block.dispose()` directly.

**Signature:**

```typescript
checkAndDelete(): void;
```
**Returns:**

void
