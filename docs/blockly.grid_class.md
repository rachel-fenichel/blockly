## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [alignXY(xy)](./blockly.grid_class.alignxy_1_method.md) |  | Given a coordinate, return the nearest coordinate aligned to the grid. |
|  [getLength()](./blockly.grid_class.getlength_1_method.md) |  | Get the length of the grid lines (in px). |
|  [getSpacing()](./blockly.grid_class.getspacing_1_method.md) |  | Get the spacing of the grid points (in px). |
|  [setLength(length)](./blockly.grid_class.setlength_1_method.md) |  | Sets the length of the grid lines. |
|  [setSnapToGrid(snap)](./blockly.grid_class.setsnaptogrid_1_method.md) |  | <p>Sets whether blocks should snap to the grid or not.</p><p>Setting this to true does not trigger snapping. If you want to snap blocks to the grid programmatically that needs to be triggered on individual top-level blocks. The next time a block is dragged and dropped it will snap to the grid.</p> |
|  [setSpacing(spacing)](./blockly.grid_class.setspacing_1_method.md) |  | <p>Sets the spacing between the centers of the grid lines.</p><p>This does not trigger snapping to the newly spaced grid. If you want to snap blocks to the grid programmatically that needs to be triggered on individual top-level blocks. The next time a block is dragged and dropped it will snap to the grid if snapping to the grid is enabled.</p> |
|  [shouldSnap()](./blockly.grid_class.shouldsnap_1_method.md) |  | Whether blocks should snap to the grid. |
