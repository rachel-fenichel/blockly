## FocusManager.getFocusedTree() method

Returns the current IFocusableTree that has focus, or null if none currently do.

Note also that if ephemeral focus is currently captured (e.g. using takeEphemeralFocus) then the returned tree here may not currently have DOM focus.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getFocusedTree(): IFocusableTree | null;
```
**Returns:**

[IFocusableTree](./blockly.ifocusabletree.md) \| null
