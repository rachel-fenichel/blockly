## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [appendDomToWorkspace(xml, workspace)](./blockly.xml.appenddomtoworkspace.md) | Decode an XML DOM and create blocks on the workspace. Position the new blocks immediately below prior blocks, aligned by their starting edge. |
|  [blockToDom(block, opt\_noId)](./blockly.xml.blocktodom.md) | Encode a block subtree as XML. |
|  [blockToDomWithXY(block, opt\_noId)](./blockly.xml.blocktodomwithxy.md) | Encode a block subtree as XML with XY coordinates. |
|  [clearWorkspaceAndLoadFromXml(xml, workspace)](./blockly.xml.clearworkspaceandloadfromxml.md) | Clear the given workspace then decode an XML DOM and create blocks on the workspace. |
|  [deleteNext(xmlBlock)](./blockly.xml.deletenext.md) | Remove any 'next' block (statements in a stack). |
|  [domToBlock(xmlBlock, workspace)](./blockly.xml.domtoblock.md) | Decode an XML block tag and create a block (and possibly sub blocks) on the workspace. |

|  [domToText(dom)](./blockly.xml.domtotext.md) | Converts a DOM structure into plain text. Currently the text format is fairly ugly: all one line with no whitespace, unless the DOM itself has whitespace built-in. |
|  [domToVariables(xmlVariables, workspace)](./blockly.xml.domtovariables.md) | Decode an XML list of variables and add the variables to the workspace. |
|  [domToWorkspace(xml, workspace)](./blockly.xml.domtoworkspace.md) | Decode an XML DOM and create blocks on the workspace. |

|  [saveWorkspaceComment(comment, skipId)](./blockly.xml.saveworkspacecomment.md) | Serializes the given workspace comment to XML. |
|  [variablesToDom(variableList)](./blockly.xml.variablestodom.md) | Encode a list of variables as XML. |
|  [workspaceToDom(workspace, skipId)](./blockly.xml.workspacetodom.md) | Encode a block tree as XML. |
