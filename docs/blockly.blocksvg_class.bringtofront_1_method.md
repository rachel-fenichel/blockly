## BlockSvg.bringToFront() method

Move this block to the front of the visible workspace. <g> tags do not respect z-index so SVG renders them in the order that they are in the DOM. By placing this block first within the block group's <g>, it will render on top of any other blocks. Use sparingly, this method is expensive because it reorders the DOM nodes.

**Signature:**

```typescript
bringToFront(blockOnly?: boolean): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  blockOnly | boolean | _(Optional)_ True to only move this block to the front without adjusting its parents. |

**Returns:**

void
