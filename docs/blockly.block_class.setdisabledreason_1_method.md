## Block.setDisabledReason() method

Add or remove a reason why the block might be disabled. If a block has any reasons to be disabled, then the block itself will be considered disabled. A block could be disabled for multiple independent reasons simultaneously, such as when the user manually disables it, or the block is invalid.

**Signature:**

```typescript
setDisabledReason(disabled: boolean, reason: string): void;
```
