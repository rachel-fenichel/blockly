[blockly](./blockly.md) &gt; [Block](./blockly.block_class.md) &gt; [setDisabledReason](./blockly.block_class.setdisabledreason_1_method.md)

## Block.setDisabledReason() method

Add or remove a reason why the block might be disabled. If a block has any reasons to be disabled, then the block itself will be considered disabled. A block could be disabled for multiple independent reasons simultaneously, such as when the user manually disables it, or the block is invalid.

**Signature:**

```typescript
setDisabledReason(disabled: boolean, reason: string): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  disabled | boolean | If true, then the block should be considered disabled for at least the provided reason, otherwise the block is no longer disabled for that reason. |
|  reason | string | A language-neutral identifier for a reason why the block could be disabled. Call this method again with the same identifier to update whether the block is currently disabled for this reason. |

**Returns:**

void
