## blockRendering.RenderInfo.measure() method

Populate this object with all sizing information needed to draw the block.

This measure pass does not propagate changes to the block (although fields may choose to rerender when getSize() is called). However, calling it repeatedly may be expensive.

**Signature:**

```typescript
measure(): void;
```
**Returns:**

void
