## BlockSvg class

Class for a block's SVG representation. Not normally called directly, workspace.newBlock() is preferred.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class BlockSvg extends Block implements IBoundedElement, IContextMenu, ICopyable<BlockCopyData>, IDraggable, IDeletable, IFocusableNode 
```
**Extends:** [Block](./blockly.block.md)

**Implements:** [IBoundedElement](./blockly.iboundedelement.md)<!-- -->, [IContextMenu](./blockly.icontextmenu.md)<!-- -->, [ICopyable](./blockly.icopyable.md)<!-- -->&lt;[BlockCopyData](./blockly.clipboard.blockcopydata.md)<!-- -->&gt;, [IDraggable](./blockly.idraggable.md)<!-- -->, [IDeletable](./blockly.ideletable.md)<!-- -->, [IFocusableNode](./blockly.ifocusablenode.md)

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(workspace, prototypeName, opt\_id)](./blockly.blocksvg._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>BlockSvg</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [COLLAPSED\_WARNING\_ID](./blockly.blocksvg.collapsed_warning_id.md) | <p><code>static</code></p><p><code>readonly</code></p> | (not declared) | ID to give the "collapsed warnings" warning. Allows us to remove the "collapsed warnings" warning without removing any warnings that belong to the block. |
|  [customContextMenu?](./blockly.blocksvg.customcontextmenu.md) |  | (p1: Array&lt;ContextMenuOption \| LegacyContextMenuOption&gt;) =&gt; void | _(Optional)_ |
|  [decompose?](./blockly.blocksvg.decompose.md) |  | (p1: [Workspace](./blockly.workspace.md)<!-- -->) =&gt; [BlockSvg](./blockly.blocksvg.md) | _(Optional)_ |
|  [height](./blockly.blocksvg.height.md) |  | number | Height of this block, not including any statement blocks above or below. Height is in workspace units. |
|  [INLINE](./blockly.blocksvg.inline.md) | <p><code>static</code></p><p><code>readonly</code></p> | (not declared) | Constant for identifying rows that are to be rendered inline. Don't collide with Blockly.inputTypes. |
|  [mutator](./blockly.blocksvg.mutator.md) |  | [MutatorIcon](./blockly.icons.mutatoricon.md) \| null | Block's mutator icon (if any). |
|  [nextConnection](./blockly.blocksvg.nextconnection.md) |  | RenderedConnection |  |
|  [outputConnection](./blockly.blocksvg.outputconnection.md) |  | RenderedConnection |  |
|  [previousConnection](./blockly.blocksvg.previousconnection.md) |  | RenderedConnection |  |
|  [rendered](./blockly.blocksvg.rendered.md) | <code>readonly</code> | (not declared) | Is this block a BlockSVG? |
|  [saveConnections?](./blockly.blocksvg.saveconnections.md) |  | (rootBlock: [BlockSvg](./blockly.blocksvg.md)<!-- -->) =&gt; void | <p>_(Optional)_ An optional method which saves a record of blocks connected to this block so they can be later restored after this block is recoomposed (reconfigured). Typically records the connected blocks on properties on blocks in the mutator flyout, so that rearranging those component blocks will automatically rearrange the corresponding connected blocks on this block after this block is recomposed.</p><p>To keep the saved connection information up-to-date, MutatorIcon arranges for an event listener to call this method any time the mutator flyout is open and a change occurs on this block's workspace.</p> |
|  [style](./blockly.blocksvg.style.md) |  | BlockStyle |  |
|  [width](./blockly.blocksvg.width.md) |  | number | Width of this block, including any connected value blocks. Width is in workspace units. |
|  [workspace](./blockly.blocksvg.workspace.md) |  | [WorkspaceSvg](./blockly.workspacesvg.md) |  |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [addClass(className)](./blockly.blocksvg.addclass.md) |  | Add a CSS class to the SVG group of this block. |
|  [addIcon(icon)](./blockly.blocksvg.addicon.md) |  |  |
|  [addSelect()](./blockly.blocksvg.addselect.md) |  | Adds the visual "select" effect to the block, but does not actually select it or fire an event. |
|  [appendInput(input)](./blockly.blocksvg.appendinput.md) |  |  |
|  [bringToFront(blockOnly)](./blockly.blocksvg.bringtofront.md) |  | Move this block to the front of the visible workspace. <g> tags do not respect z-index so SVG renders them in the order that they are in the DOM. By placing this block first within the block group's <g>, it will render on top of any other blocks. Use sparingly, this method is expensive because it reorders the DOM nodes. |
|  [bumpNeighbours()](./blockly.blocksvg.bumpneighbours.md) |  | <p>Bumps unconnected blocks out of alignment.</p><p>Two blocks which aren't actually connected should not coincidentally line up on screen, because that creates confusion for end-users.</p> |
|  [calculateContextMenuLocation(e)](./blockly.blocksvg.calculatecontextmenulocation.md) | <code>protected</code> | Gets the location in which to show the context menu for this block. Use the location of a click if the block was clicked, or a location based on the block's fields otherwise. |
|  [canBeFocused()](./blockly.blocksvg.canbefocused.md) |  | See IFocusableNode.canBeFocused. |
|  [checkAndDelete()](./blockly.blocksvg.checkanddelete.md) |  | Delete a block and hide chaff when doing so. The block will not be deleted if it's in a flyout. This is called from the context menu and keyboard shortcuts as the full delete action. If you are disposing of a block from the workspace and don't need to perform flyout checks, handle event grouping, or hide chaff, then use <code>block.dispose()</code> directly. |
|  [dispose(healStack, animate)](./blockly.blocksvg.dispose.md) |  | Dispose of this block. |
|  [disposeInternal()](./blockly.blocksvg.disposeinternal.md) |  | Disposes of this block without doing things required by the top block. E.g. does trigger UI effects, remove nodes, etc. |
|  [drag(newLoc, e)](./blockly.blocksvg.drag.md) |  | Drags the block to the given location. |
|  [endDrag(e)](./blockly.blocksvg.enddrag.md) |  | Ends the drag on the block. |
|  [generateContextMenu(e)](./blockly.blocksvg.generatecontextmenu.md) | <code>protected</code> | Generate the context menu for this block. |
|  [getBoundingRectangle()](./blockly.blocksvg.getboundingrectangle.md) |  | Returns the coordinates of a bounding box describing the dimensions of this block and any blocks stacked below it. Coordinate system: workspace coordinates. |
|  [getBoundingRectangleWithoutChildren()](./blockly.blocksvg.getboundingrectanglewithoutchildren.md) |  | Returns the coordinates of a bounding box describing the dimensions of this block alone. Coordinate system: workspace coordinates. |
|  [getChildren(ordered)](./blockly.blocksvg.getchildren.md) |  | Find all the blocks that are directly nested inside this one. Includes value and statement inputs, as well as any following statement. Excludes any connection on an output tab or any preceding statement. Blocks are optionally sorted by position; top to bottom. |
|  [getColour()](./blockly.blocksvg.getcolour.md) |  | Get the colour of a block. |
|  [getColourSecondary()](./blockly.blocksvg.getcoloursecondary.md) |  | Get the secondary colour of a block. |
|  [getColourTertiary()](./blockly.blocksvg.getcolourtertiary.md) |  | Get the tertiary colour of a block. |
|  [getFocusableElement()](./blockly.blocksvg.getfocusableelement.md) |  | See IFocusableNode.getFocusableElement. |
|  [getFocusableTree()](./blockly.blocksvg.getfocusabletree.md) |  | See IFocusableNode.getFocusableTree. |
|  [getNextBlock()](./blockly.blocksvg.getnextblock.md) |  | Return the next statement block directly connected to this block. |
|  [getPreviousBlock()](./blockly.blocksvg.getpreviousblock.md) |  | Returns the block connected to the previous connection. |
|  [getRelativeToSurfaceXY()](./blockly.blocksvg.getrelativetosurfacexy.md) |  | Return the coordinates of the top-left corner of this block relative to the drawing surface's origin (0,0), in workspace units. If the block is on the workspace, (0, 0) is the origin of the workspace coordinate system. This does not change with workspace scale. |
|  [getStyle()](./blockly.blocksvg.getstyle.md) |  | Returns the BlockStyle object used to style this block. |
|  [getSvgRoot()](./blockly.blocksvg.getsvgroot.md) |  | Return the root node of the SVG or null if none exists. |
