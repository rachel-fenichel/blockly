## Gesture.currentDropdownOwner property

The owner of the dropdownDiv when this gesture first starts. Needed because we'll close the dropdown before fields get to act on their events, and some fields care about who owns the dropdown.

**Signature:**

```typescript
currentDropdownOwner: Field | null;
```
