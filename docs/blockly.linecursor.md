## LineCursor class

Class for a line cursor.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class LineCursor extends Marker 
```
**Extends:** [Marker](./blockly.marker.md)

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(workspace)](./blockly.linecursor._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>LineCursor</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [type](./blockly.linecursor.type.md) |  | string |  |
|  [workspace](./blockly.linecursor.workspace.md) | <p><code>protected</code></p><p><code>readonly</code></p> | [WorkspaceSvg](./blockly.workspacesvg.md) |  |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [atEndOfLine()](./blockly.linecursor.atendofline.md) |  | Returns true iff the node to which we would navigate if in() were called is the same as the node to which we would navigate if next() were called - in effect, if the LineCursor is at the end of the 'current line' of the program. |
|  [getCurNode()](./blockly.linecursor.getcurnode.md) |  | <p>Get the current location of the cursor.</p><p>Overrides normal Marker getCurNode to update the current node from the selected block. This typically happens via the selection listener but that is not called immediately when <code>Gesture</code> calls <code>Blockly.common.setSelected</code>. In particular the listener runs after showing the context menu.</p> |
|  [getFirstNode()](./blockly.linecursor.getfirstnode.md) |  | Get the first navigable node on the workspace, or null if none exist. |
|  [getLastNode()](./blockly.linecursor.getlastnode.md) |  | Get the last navigable node on the workspace, or null if none exist. |
|  [getNextNode(node, isValid, loop)](./blockly.linecursor.getnextnode.md) |  | Get the next node in the AST, optionally allowing for loopback. |
|  [getPreviousNode(node, isValid, loop)](./blockly.linecursor.getpreviousnode.md) |  | Get the previous node in the AST, optionally allowing for loopback. |
|  [in()](./blockly.linecursor.in.md) |  | Moves the cursor to the next input connection or field in the pre order traversal. |
|  [next()](./blockly.linecursor.next.md) |  | Moves the cursor to the next previous connection, next connection or block in the pre order traversal. Finds the next node in the pre order traversal. |
|  [out()](./blockly.linecursor.out.md) |  | Moves the cursor to the previous input connection or field in the pre order traversal. |
|  [postDelete()](./blockly.linecursor.postdelete.md) |  | Move the cursor to the first valid location in this.potentialNodes, following a block deletion. |
|  [preDelete(deletedBlock)](./blockly.linecursor.predelete.md) |  | <p>Prepare for the deletion of a block by making a list of nodes we could move the cursor to afterwards and save it to this.potentialNodes.</p><p>After the deletion has occurred, call postDelete to move it to the first valid node on that list.</p><p>The locations to try (in order of preference) are:</p><p>- The current location. - The connection to which the deleted block is attached. - The block connected to the next connection of the deleted block. - The parent block of the deleted block. - A location on the workspace beneath the deleted block.</p><p>N.B.: When block is deleted, all of the blocks conneccted to that block's inputs are also deleted, but not blocks connected to its next connection.</p> |
|  [prev()](./blockly.linecursor.prev.md) |  | Moves the cursor to the previous next connection or previous connection in the pre order traversal. |
|  [setCurNode(newNode)](./blockly.linecursor.setcurnode.md) |  | <p>Set the location of the cursor and draw it.</p><p>Overrides normal Marker setCurNode logic to call this.drawMarker() instead of this.drawer.draw() directly.</p> |
