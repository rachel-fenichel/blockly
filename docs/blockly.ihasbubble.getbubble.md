## IHasBubble.getBubble() method

Returns the current IBubble that implementations are managing, or null if there isn't one.

Note that this cannot be expected to return null if bubbleIsVisible() returns false, i.e., the nullability of the returned bubble does not necessarily imply visibility.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getBubble(): IBubble | null;
```
**Returns:**

[IBubble](./blockly.ibubble.md) \| null

The current IBubble maintained by implementations, or null if there is not one.
