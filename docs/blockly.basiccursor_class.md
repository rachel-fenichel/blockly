## BasicCursor class

Class for a basic cursor. This will allow the user to get to all nodes in the AST by hitting next or previous.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class BasicCursor extends Cursor 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [Cursor](./blockly.cursor_class.md)

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)()](./blockly.basiccursor_class._constructor__1_constructor.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>BasicCursor</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [registrationName](./blockly.basiccursor_class.registrationname_property.md) | <p><code>readonly</code></p><p><code>static</code></p> | (not declared) | Name used for registering a basic cursor. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [getNextNode\_(node, isValid)](./blockly.basiccursor_class.getnextnode__1_method.md) | <code>protected</code> | Uses pre order traversal to navigate the Blockly AST. This will allow a user to easily navigate the entire Blockly AST without having to go in and out levels on the tree. |
|  [getPreviousNode\_(node, isValid)](./blockly.basiccursor_class.getpreviousnode__1_method.md) | <code>protected</code> | Reverses the pre order traversal in order to find the previous node. This will allow a user to easily navigate the entire Blockly AST without having to go in and out levels on the tree. |
|  [in()](./blockly.basiccursor_class.in_1_method.md) |  | For a basic cursor we only have the ability to go next and previous, so in will also allow the user to get to the next node in the pre order traversal. |
|  [next()](./blockly.basiccursor_class.next_1_method.md) |  | Find the next node in the pre order traversal. |
|  [out()](./blockly.basiccursor_class.out_1_method.md) |  | For a basic cursor we only have the ability to go next and previous, so out will allow the user to get to the previous node in the pre order traversal. |
|  [prev()](./blockly.basiccursor_class.prev_1_method.md) |  | Find the previous node in the pre order traversal. |
|  [validNode\_(node)](./blockly.basiccursor_class.validnode__1_method.md) | <code>protected</code> | Decides what nodes to traverse and which ones to skip. Currently, it skips output, stack and workspace nodes. |
