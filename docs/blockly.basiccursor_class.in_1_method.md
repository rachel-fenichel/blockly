## BasicCursor.in() method

For a basic cursor we only have the ability to go next and previous, so in will also allow the user to get to the next node in the pre order traversal.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
in(): ASTNode | null;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

ASTNode \| null

The next node, or null if the current node is not set or there is no next value.
