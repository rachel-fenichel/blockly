## CodeGenerator.FUNCTION\_NAME\_PLACEHOLDER\_ property

This is used as a placeholder in functions defined using CodeGenerator.provideFunction\_. It must not be legal code that could legitimately appear in a function definition (or comment), and it must not confuse the regular expression parser.

**Signature:**

```typescript
FUNCTION_NAME_PLACEHOLDER_: string;
```
