## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [connect\_(childConnection)](./blockly.connection.connect_.md) | <code>protected</code> | Connect two connections together. This is the connection on the superior block. |
|  [connect(otherConnection)](./blockly.connection.connect.md) |  | Connect this connection to another connection. |
|  [disconnect()](./blockly.connection.disconnect.md) |  | Disconnect this connection. |
|  [disconnectInternal(setParent)](./blockly.connection.disconnectinternal.md) | <code>protected</code> | Disconnect two blocks that are connected by this connection. |
|  [getCheck()](./blockly.connection.getcheck.md) |  | Get a connection's compatibility. |
|  [getConnectionForOrphanedConnection(startBlock, orphanConnection)](./blockly.connection.getconnectionfororphanedconnection.md) | <code>static</code> | Returns the connection (starting at the startBlock) which will accept the given connection. This includes compatible connection types and connection checks. |
|  [getParentAndChildConnections()](./blockly.connection.getparentandchildconnections.md) | <code>protected</code> | Returns the parent connection (superior) and child connection (inferior) given this connection and the connection it is connected to. |
|  [getShadowDom(returnCurrent)](./blockly.connection.getshadowdom.md) |  | Returns the xml representation of the connection's shadow block. |
|  [getShadowState(returnCurrent)](./blockly.connection.getshadowstate.md) |  | Returns the serialized object representation of the connection's shadow block. |
|  [getSourceBlock()](./blockly.connection.getsourceblock.md) |  | Get the source block for this connection. |
|  [isConnected()](./blockly.connection.isconnected.md) |  | Is the connection connected? |
|  [isSuperior()](./blockly.connection.issuperior.md) |  | Does the connection belong to a superior block (higher in the source stack)? |
|  [onCheckChanged\_()](./blockly.connection.oncheckchanged_.md) | <code>protected</code> | Function to be called when this connection's compatible types have changed. |
|  [reconnect(block, inputName)](./blockly.connection.reconnect.md) |  | Reconnects this connection to the input with the given name on the given block. If there is already a connection connected to that input, that connection is disconnected. |
|  [respawnShadow\_()](./blockly.connection.respawnshadow_.md) | <code>protected</code> | Respawn the shadow block if there was one connected to the this connection. |
|  [setCheck(check)](./blockly.connection.setcheck.md) |  | Change a connection's compatibility. |
|  [setShadowDom(shadowDom)](./blockly.connection.setshadowdom.md) |  | Changes the connection's shadow block. |
|  [setShadowState(shadowState)](./blockly.connection.setshadowstate.md) |  | Changes the connection's shadow block. |
|  [targetBlock()](./blockly.connection.targetblock.md) |  | Returns the block that this connection connects to. |
|  [toString()](./blockly.connection.tostring.md) |  | This method returns a string describing this Connection in developer terms (English only). Intended to on be used in console logs and errors. |
