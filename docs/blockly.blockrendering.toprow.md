## blockRendering.TopRow class

An object containing information about what elements are in the top row of a block as well as sizing information for the top row. Elements in a top row can consist of corners, hats, spacers, and previous connections. After this constructor is called, the row will contain all non-spacer elements it needs.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class TopRow extends Row 
```
**Extends:** [Row](./blockly.blockrendering.row.md)
