## fieldRegistry.RegistrableField interface

Represents the static methods that must be defined on any field that is registered, i.e. the constructor and fromJson methods.

Because we don't know which Field subclass will be registered, we are unable to typecheck the parameters of the constructor.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface RegistrableField 
```
