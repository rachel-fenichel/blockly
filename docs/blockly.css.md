## Css namespace

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [inject(hasCss, pathToMedia)](./blockly.css.inject.md) | Inject the CSS into the DOM. This is preferable over using a regular CSS file since: a) It loads synchronously and doesn't force a redraw later. b) It speeds up loading by not blocking on a separate HTTP transfer. c) The CSS content may be made dynamic depending on init options. |
|  [register(cssContent)](./blockly.css.register.md) | Add some CSS to the blob that will be injected later. Allows optional components such as fields and the toolbox to store separate CSS. |
