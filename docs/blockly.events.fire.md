## Events.fire() function

Enqueue an event to be dispatched to change listeners.

Notes:

- Events are enqueued until a timeout, generally after rendering is complete or at the end of the current microtask, if not running in a browser. - Queued events are subject to destructive modification by being combined with later-enqueued events, but only until they are fired. - Events are dispatched via the fireChangeListener method on the affected workspace.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function fire(event: Abstract): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  event | [Abstract](./blockly.events.abstract.md) | Any Blockly event. |

**Returns:**

void
