## FocusManager.focusNode() method

Focuses DOM input on the specified node, and marks it as actively focused.

Any previously focused node will be updated to be passively highlighted (if it's in a different focusable tree) or blurred (if it's in the same one).

\*\*Important\*\*: If the provided node is not able to be focused (e.g. its canBeFocused() method returns false), it will be ignored and any existing focus state will remain unchanged.

**Signature:**

```typescript
focusNode(focusableNode: IFocusableNode): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  focusableNode | [IFocusableNode](./blockly.ifocusablenode.md) | The node that should receive active focus. |

**Returns:**

void
