## Field.saveState() method

Saves this fields value as something which can be serialized to JSON. Should only be called by the serialization system.

**Signature:**

```typescript
saveState(_doFullSerialization?: boolean): any;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  \_doFullSerialization | boolean | _(Optional)_ If true, this signals to the field that if it normally just saves a reference to some state (eg variable fields) it should instead serialize the full state of the thing being referenced. See the [field serialization docs](https://developers.devsite.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/fields/customizing-fields/creating#full_serialization_and_backing_data) for more information. |

**Returns:**

any

JSON serializable state.
