## IFocusableTree.getNestedTrees() method

Returns all directly nested trees under this tree.

Note that the returned list of trees doesn't need to be stable, however all returned trees \*do\* need to be registered with FocusManager. Additionally, this must return actual nested trees as omitting a nested tree will affect how focus changes map to a specific node and its tree, potentially leading to user confusion.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getNestedTrees(): Array<IFocusableTree>;
```
**Returns:**

Array&lt;[IFocusableTree](./blockly.ifocusabletree.md)<!-- -->&gt;
