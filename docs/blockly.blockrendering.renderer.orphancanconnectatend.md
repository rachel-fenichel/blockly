## blockRendering.Renderer.orphanCanConnectAtEnd() method

Checks if an orphaned block can connect to the "end" of the topBlock's block-clump. If the clump is a row the end is the last input. If the clump is a stack, the end is the last next connection. If the clump is neither, then this returns false.

**Signature:**

```typescript
protected orphanCanConnectAtEnd(topBlock: BlockSvg, orphanBlock: BlockSvg, localType: number): boolean;
```

|  orphanBlock | [BlockSvg](./blockly.blocksvg.md) | The orphan block that wants to find a home. |
|  localType | number | The type of the connection being dragged. |

**Returns:**
