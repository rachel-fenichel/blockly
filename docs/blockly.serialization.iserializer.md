Serializes and deserializes a plugin or system.

**Signature:**

```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [priority](./blockly.serialization.iserializer.priority.md) |  | number | A priority value used to determine the order of deserializing state. More positive priorities are deserialized before less positive priorities. Eg if you have priorities (0, -10, 10, 100) the order of deserialiation will be (100, 10, 0, -10). If two serializers have the same priority, they are deserialized in an arbitrary order relative to each other. |
