## FocusManager.focusNode() method

Focuses DOM input on the specified node, and marks it as actively focused.

Any previously focused node will be updated to be passively highlighted (if it's in a different focusable tree) or blurred (if it's in the same one).

\*\*Important\*\*: If the provided node is not able to be focused (e.g. its canBeFocused() method returns false), it will be ignored and any existing focus state will remain unchanged.

**Signature:**

```typescript
focusNode(focusableNode: IFocusableNode): void;
```
