|  [Renderer](./blockly.thrasos.renderer.md) | <p>The thrasos renderer. This is a more modern take on the legacy geras renderer.</p><p>Thrasos is the ancient Greek spirit of boldness.</p> |
|  [RenderInfo](./blockly.thrasos.renderinfo.md) | <p>An object containing all sizing information needed to draw this block.</p><p>This measure pass does not propagate changes to the block (although fields may choose to rerender when getSize() is called). However, calling it repeatedly may be expensive.</p> |
