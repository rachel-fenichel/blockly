## blockRendering namespace

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [BottomRow](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.bottomrow_class.md) | An object containing information about what elements are in the bottom row of a block as well as spacing information for the bottom row. Elements in a bottom row can consist of corners, spacers and next connections. |
|  [Connection](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.connection_class.md) | The base class to represent a connection and the space that it takes up on the block. |
|  [ConstantProvider](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.constantprovider_class.md) | An object that provides constants for rendering blocks. |
|  [Debug](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.debug_class.md) | An object that renders rectangles and dots for debugging rendering code. |
|  [Drawer](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.drawer_class.md) | An object that draws a block based on the given rendering information. |
|  [ExternalValueInput](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.externalvalueinput_class.md) | An object containing information about the space an external value input takes up during rendering |
|  [Field](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.field_class.md) | An object containing information about the space a field takes up during rendering |
|  [Hat](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.hat_class.md) | An object containing information about the space a hat takes up during rendering. |
|  [Icon](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.icon_class.md) | An object containing information about the space an icon takes up during rendering |
|  [InlineInput](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.inlineinput_class.md) | An object containing information about the space an inline input takes up during rendering |
|  [InputConnection](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.inputconnection_class.md) | The base class to represent an input that takes up space on a block during rendering |
|  [InputRow](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.inputrow_class.md) | An object containing information about a row that holds one or more inputs. |
|  [InRowSpacer](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.inrowspacer_class.md) | An object containing information about a spacer between two elements on a row. |
|  [JaggedEdge](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.jaggededge_class.md) | An object containing information about the jagged edge of a collapsed block takes up during rendering |
|  [MarkerSvg](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.markersvg_class.md) | Class for a marker. |
|  [Measurable](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.measurable_class.md) | The base class to represent a part of a block that takes up space during rendering. The constructor for each non-spacer Measurable records the size of the block element (e.g. field, statement input). |
|  [NextConnection](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.nextconnection_class.md) | An object containing information about the space a next connection takes up during rendering. |
|  [OutputConnection](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.outputconnection_class.md) | An object containing information about the space an output connection takes up during rendering. |
|  [PathObject](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.pathobject_class.md) | An object that handles creating and setting each of the SVG elements used by the renderer. |
|  [PreviousConnection](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.previousconnection_class.md) | An object containing information about the space a previous connection takes up during rendering. |
|  [Renderer](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.renderer_class.md) | The base class for a block renderer. |
|  [RenderInfo](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.renderinfo_class.md) | <p>An object containing all sizing information needed to draw this block.</p><p>This measure pass does not propagate changes to the block (although fields may choose to rerender when getSize() is called). However, calling it repeatedly may be expensive.</p> |
|  [RoundCorner](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.roundcorner_class.md) | An object containing information about the space a rounded corner takes up during rendering. |
|  [Row](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.row_class.md) | An object representing a single row on a rendered block and all of its subcomponents. |
|  [SpacerRow](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.spacerrow_class.md) | An object containing information about a spacer between two rows. |
|  [SquareCorner](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.squarecorner_class.md) | An object containing information about the space a square corner takes up during rendering. |
|  [StatementInput](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.statementinput_class.md) | An object containing information about the space a statement input takes up during rendering |
|  [TopRow](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.toprow_class.md) | An object containing information about what elements are in the top row of a block as well as sizing information for the top row. Elements in a top row can consist of corners, hats, spacers, and previous connections. After this constructor is called, the row will contain all non-spacer elements it needs. |

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [register(name, rendererClass)](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.register_1_function.md) | Registers a new renderer. |
|  [unregister(name)](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.unregister_1_function.md) | Unregisters the renderer registered with the given name. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [IPathObject](./blockly.blockrendering_namespace.ipathobject_interface.md) | An interface for a block's path object. |
