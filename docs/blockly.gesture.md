## Gesture class

Class for one gesture.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class Gesture 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(e, creatorWorkspace)](./blockly.gesture._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>Gesture</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [currentDropdownOwner](./blockly.gesture.currentdropdownowner.md) |  | [Field](./blockly.field.md) \| null | The owner of the dropdownDiv when this gesture first starts. Needed because we'll close the dropdown before fields get to act on their events, and some fields care about who owns the dropdown. |
|  [isEnding\_](./blockly.gesture.isending_.md) | <code>protected</code> | boolean | Boolean used internally to break a cycle in disposal. |
|  [startWorkspace\_](./blockly.gesture.startworkspace_.md) | <code>protected</code> | [WorkspaceSvg](./blockly.workspacesvg.md) \| null | The workspace that the gesture started on. There may be multiple workspaces on a page; this is more accurate than using Blockly.common.getMainWorkspace(). |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [getCurrentDragger()](./blockly.gesture.getcurrentdragger.md) |  | Returns the current dragger if the gesture is a drag. |
|  [inProgress()](./blockly.gesture.inprogress.md) | <code>static</code> | Is a drag or other gesture currently in progress on any workspace? |
