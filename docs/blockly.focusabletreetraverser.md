## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [findFocusableNodeFor(element, tree)](./blockly.focusabletreetraverser.findfocusablenodefor.md) | <code>static</code> | <p>Returns the IFocusableNode corresponding to the specified HTML or SVG element iff it's the root element or a descendent of the root element of the specified IFocusableTree.</p><p>If the element exists within the specified tree's DOM structure but does not directly correspond to a node, the nearest parent node (or the tree's root) will be returned to represent the provided element.</p><p>If the tree contains another nested IFocusableTree, the nested tree may be traversed but its nodes will never be returned here per the contract of IFocusableTree.lookUpFocusableNode.</p><p>The provided element must have a non-null ID that conforms to the contract mentioned in IFocusableNode.</p> |
|  [findFocusedNode(tree)](./blockly.focusabletreetraverser.findfocusednode.md) | <code>static</code> | <p>Returns the current IFocusableNode that is styled (and thus represented) as having either passive or active focus, only considering HTML and SVG elements.</p><p>This can match against the tree's root.</p><p>Note that this will never return a node from a nested sub-tree as that tree should specifically be used to retrieve its focused node.</p> |
